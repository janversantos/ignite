  "title": "Cornerstone",
  "artist": "Hillsong Worship",
  "ccli": "6158927",
  "originalKey": "A",
  "defaultKey": "A",
  "tags": ["worship", "slow"],
  "structure": ["Verse 1", "Chorus", "Bridge"],
  "sections": [
    {
      "id": "v1",
      "name": "Verse 1",
      "order": 1,
      "chords": "C  Am  F  G",
      "snippet": "My hope is built... (on nothing less)",
      "notes": "Gentle, contemplative"
    }
  ]
}
```

**What to include:**
- `chords`: Just chord progressions (legal!)
- `snippet`: First line + keywords in parentheses
- `notes`: Performance notes for team

cd "D:\projects\Ignite Chords\ignite-chords-app"
# Edit data/songs.json (copy existing song format)
git add data/songs.json
git commit -m "Add [Song Name]"
git push
```

**Change Keys:**
Just update `defaultKey` in songs.json

**Update Worship Leader Names:**

## ðŸš€ Next Steps

**Recommended:**

3. Add chord charts to 5-10 popular songs
4. Test on phones (iOS + Android)

**Optional Improvements:**
- Add more chord charts
- Add song categories/filters

## ðŸ’¡ Tips

**Legal & Safe:**
- Only chord progressions (no full lyrics)
- Snippet format keeps you legal
- Team already knows the songs anyway!

**Weekly Workflow:**
- Saturday: Add next week's songs
- Push to git
- Sunday morning: Team has updated app offline!

**Backup Plan:**
- `out/` folder = complete static site
- Can host anywhere (even USB stick!)
- If Vercel down, send `out/` folder via WhatsApp

## ðŸ“ž Support

**Common Issues:**

1. **"Can't see new songs"**
   - Pull down to refresh on phone
   - Or clear browser cache

2. **"App not installing"**
   - Must visit via HTTPS URL
   - Local IP (192.168.x.x) works too

3. **"Need to add lyrics"**
   - Check if church has CCLI license
   - Or keep snippet format (legal!)
